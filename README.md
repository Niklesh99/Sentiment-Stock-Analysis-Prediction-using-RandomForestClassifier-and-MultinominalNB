# Sentiment-Stock-Analysis-Prediction-using-RandomForestClassifier-and-MultinominalNB


This is a Machine Learning Project to create a Model which accepts stock news headlines as input and predict the output whether the stock price will increase or not.
In this Project, the model uses CountVectorizer and Tfidfvectorizer to convert features into numerical data and uses RandomForestClassifier to train and Predict data.
I also uses Multinominal-naive Bayes to predict the output.
